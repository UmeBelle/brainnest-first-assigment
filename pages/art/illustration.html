    <h1>Digital Illustration</h1>
    <p>
        Digital painting/illustration mainly refers to the process of creating paintings on computer software based on computers or graphic tables.<br>
        Through pixel simulation, digital brushes in digital software<br>
        can imitate traditional painting paints and tools, such as oil, acrylic acid, pastel, charcoal, and airbrush.
