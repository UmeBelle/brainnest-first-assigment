    <h1>Artificial Inteligence Art</h1>
    <p>
        As technology develops, the artificial inteligence generated art became extremely popular. <br>
        Many critics proclaimed the demise of art, the elimination of creative jobs, and the erosion of human creativity. <br>
        <br>
        Those critics, which are not invalid, are still arbitrary. The solid and big issue is, art theft. <br>
        Artificial inteligences (AI, for short) need to be trained using thousands of digital artwork, which is commonly stolen<br>
        and used without the artist's permission.<br>
        To start, <strong>reposting an artist's work without their permission is a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright">copyright infringement</a>.</strong><br>
        By common sense (and copyright laws), the use of copyrighted work for any kind of project is also a copyright infringement.<br>
        Meaning that the training of AIs with other artist's works is, by simple math, art theft.
