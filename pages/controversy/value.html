    <h1>Value of Digital Art</h1>
    <p>
        The most common controversy surrounding digital art is it's value. The general critic is, because the media is digital (computer made), it's easy to produce and has no value. <br>
        Contradictory to this belief, digital art is not as easy as pressing one button. The different techniques always use the same basic tool; a drawing tablet, a mouse, or both. <br>
        Mastering both of these tools, and finding a technique that works for the final piece you wanna create, takes a lot of time, practice and study. <br>
        Compared to traditional art (Mistakenly referred as "hand drawn"), digital art requires the same level of muscular and visual memory.
