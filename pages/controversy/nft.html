    <h1>NFTs</h1>
    <p>
        A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital identifier that cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided, <br>
        that is recorded in a blockchain, and that is used to certify authenticity and ownership.<br>
        The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the blockchain and can be transferred by the owner,<br>
        allowing NFTs to be sold and traded. NFTs can be created by anybody, and require few or no coding skills to create.

        <br>
        Digital art is a common use case for NFTs. High-profile auctions of NFTs linked to digital art have received considerable public attention.<br>
        The work entitled "Merge" by artist Pak was the most expensive NFT, with an auction price of US$91.8 million. <br>
        <br>
        Some NFT collections, including Bored Apes, EtherRocks, and CryptoPunks are examples of generative art,<br>
        where many different images are created by assembling a selection of simple picture components in different combinations.<br>
        Generative art, by itself, fulfills the criteria of the "lack of value" of digital art, being randomly generated by an algorythm<br>
        using different premade assets ("parts" of an illustration). Meaning you can get a wide "variety" of "unique" illustrations out of a small amount of assets. <br>
        Besides, no centralized means of authentication exists to prevent stolen and counterfeit digital works from being sold as NFTs, <br>
        leaving a wide breach for art theft and scams.
